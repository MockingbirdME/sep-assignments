1.  Using proper pseudo-code, describe three or more primitive algorithms used in your day-to-day life. Write your answers in a file called intro_algorithms_answers.txt. Here are some ideas:

  calculating a tip:
    def calculatingTip(bill)
      tip = (bill * .2)
      if (the service was good)
        if tip * .5 > 2
          tip += tip * .5
        else
          tip += tip + 2
        end
      else
        if serviceWasBad
          tip -= tip * .5
        elsif serviceWasReallyBad
          askForManager(server)
        end
      end
    end

  determining what to wear:
    def gettingDressed(chest_of_drawers, closet)
      underGarments = [underpants, undershirt, socks]
      clothesToWear = []
      underGarments.each do |item|
        clothesToWear << chest_of_drawers.item[0]
      end
      if okToWearJeans
        clothes_to_wear << chest_of_drawers.jeans[0]
        if goingToWork
          clothes_to_wear << chest_of_drawers.dressSocks[0]
        else
          clothes_to_wear << chest_of_drawers.comfySocks[0]
        end
      else
        clothes_to_wear << closet.slacks[0]
        clothes_to_wear << chest_of_drawers.dressSocks[0]
      end
      if goingToWork || wantToLookNice
        i = 0
        clothes_to_wear << closet.shirt[0]
        while wifeDoesntLikesMyOutfit
          clothes_to_wear.pop
          i += 1
          clothes_to_wear << closet.shirt[i]
        end
      else
        clothes_to_wear << chest_of_drawers.tShirt[0]
      end
      clothesToWear.each { |item| putOn(item)}
    end

  getting to work:
    def goingToWork(currentLocation)
      getToKitchen(currentLocation)
      walkDownHallway
      goUpStairs
      rotate(90, right)
      advancePaces(2)
      rotate(120, left)
      openDoor(office)
      advancePaces(1)
      rotate(180)
      closeDoor(office)
      rotate(150, left)
      advancePaces(2)
      sit(officeChair)
    end
