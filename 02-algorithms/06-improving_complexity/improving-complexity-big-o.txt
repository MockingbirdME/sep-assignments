each version the has a simplified complexity of n^2.  Version one accepts n^2 but attempts to slim down each repetition's time.  Version two takes the combine time and reduces it from O(n^2) to O(n) and the sorting time from O(n^2) to O(n * 1/2n) this all still simplifies to O(n^2) but will run faster than it's basic version.  Version three does not attempt to improve the speed of either part of the function but does limit the amount of data stored in arrays by taking additional time to slim down the combine array as the sorted one grows thereby reducing the amount of space needed to run the function.
